        <p class="centered" id="text">Hi, my name is Anya Khosla. I'm a first year Computer Engineering major from California
             who loves to play softball and volleyball, crochet, listen to music, 
             and spend time with my friends. I am really passionate about educational equity, and in high
             school I was the director of a program who taught elementary school students math and reading skills.
             I really enjoyed working with the students every week.</p>
